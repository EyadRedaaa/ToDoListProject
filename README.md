# ToDoListProject
The To-Do List project is a simple application aimed at helping users organize their daily tasks. It allows users to add new tasks, modify them, delete them, and mark completed tasks. This project will be built using Java and a graphical user interface (GUI) to make interaction with the application easy and visual.
